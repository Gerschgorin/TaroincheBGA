QOL :
Hide bids/starter AFTER the first card is played
 add player bubbles for belote (and coinche ?)
 endGame : tableau resultats (stEndHand : KEEP TRACK OF SCORES FOR EACH HAND)
 add coinche animation
 use sprite for colors

Maybe :
    hide final score till the end
    subscribe to ALL message 
    let cards stay until next played (hide previous trick) OR WAIT BEFORE stNextPlayer !
    could order previousTrick by changing weights
